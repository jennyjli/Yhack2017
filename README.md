# Coquere - A Recipe Search App
## Description ##
Coquere (Latin for "to cook") is an Android application that finds recipes for the food present in an input image. The app uses the Google Cloud Vision API and the Food2For API.

## How it works ##
The user first inputs an image by either taking a photo or choosing an image from the album.

The input image will now show up on the screen. Once the user clicks the button, the app will use the APIs to recognize ingredients in the image and search for recipes online.

A list of recipes will be displayed for the user to choose. If the user is not satisfied with the list of recipes, he/she may use the "return"  button to start over.

Once the user clicks on one of the recipes, the app will direct the user to the recipe. Ta-da! Have fun cooking and enjoy your food!
